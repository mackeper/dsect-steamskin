Your video card is not recognized or is not supported consequently your system will not run, will crash or cannot provide an adequate gaming experience.<br>

[NOTES:<br>
Do we want to say Win2k on preferred configuration?<br>
What about sound? Do we want to suggest Better config? What about 5.1? etc.<br>
Minimum requires internet connection yet preferred does not?<br>
Does minimum require internet connection? Can we say dialup?<br>
For preferred, shouldn't we suggest broadband internet connection w/ min speed? Say 256kb?<br>
Do we want to suggest that if they bought the game and cannot meet requirements that the product can/should be returned? (No)
What if they are using steam? Do we have any "refund" procedure? Can they buy the game for a system that can't play it?<br>
Need to be more explicit on h/w requirements on steam purchases<br>
